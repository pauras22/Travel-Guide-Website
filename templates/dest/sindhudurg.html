{% block hp1 %}<p>Sindhudurg island-fort was built by Shivaji Maharaj, the 17th-century ruler of Maratha Empire.[3] Its main objective was to counter the rising influence of foreign (English,Mugahls, Dutch, French and Portuguese) merchants and to curb the rise of Siddis of Janjira.[4] Construction was supervised by Hiroji Indulkar in 1664. The fort was built on a small island known as the Khurte island. </p>

             The original fort was built by Bhojraja Shilahar between 1196 and 1206 AD. The Maratha king Shivaji Maharaj took control of this fort from Adil Shahi dynasty in 1656 AD and renamed it as Vijay Durg. Thereafter the fort was the main Maratha naval base under Kanoji Angre. The fort was attacked in 1717, 1720 and 1724 AD by the British, Portuguese and Dutch - but could not be conquered. The fort was under the control of British and Peshwas in 1756 AD and remained with the Peshwas till 1818 AD. In 1818 Vijaydurg was totally fell into the hands of the British Empire.

The fort is constructed using laterite stones. The fort consists of 27 bastions out of which three are three-storied. The main entrance of the fort faces the north. Out of the original imposing structure, some of the structures still remain including the storage area for food grains, prison, a huge water tank, and cannon. A 10 m high compound wall, about 300 feet away from the fort deep in the sea, has been discovered recently. It was served as a defense against attacking ships. The fort also has a 200 m long tunnel for emergency evacuation. It is believed that the region around the banks of the Vaghotan River was a dock, used by the Marathas for building and repairing their ships.
